        <li>Hollow out bell peppers by removing and discarding the tops, seeds, and membranes. Slice the bottoms of the peppers if necessary to make sure they stand up straight </li>
        <li>Arrange peppers in a baking dish with the hollowed sides facing upward.</li>
        <li>Prepare filling by mixing cooked beef, cooked rice, 1/2 of the tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Spoon an equal amount of filling into each hollowed pepper.</li>
        <li>Mix remaining tomato sauce and Italian seasoning in a bowl, and pour over the stuffed peppers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, basting with sauce every 15 minutes, until peppers are tender, about 1 hour.</li>
